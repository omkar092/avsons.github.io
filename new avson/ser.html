                    <h3>2D drawings in autocad</h3>
                     <p>2D drafting and drawing is the process of creating and editing technical drawings,
            as well as annotating designs. Drafters use computer-aided design (CAD) software to develop floor plans, 
                        building permit drawings, building inspection plans and landscaping layouts.</p>

                    <h3>3D design in solidwork</h3>
                     <p>SolidWorks is computer-aided design (CAD) software owned by Dassault Syst√®mes.
                 It uses the principle of parametric design and generates three kinds of interconnected files: the part, 
                 the assembly, and the drawing.</p>

                    <h3>CNC Turret punching</h3>
                     <p>A turret punch, also called a turret press, is a machine that uses punching to form metal shapes.
                     Turret punching involves pushing a punch through a piece of metal to create a hole.</p>

                    <h3>Press break bending drawings</h3>
                     <p>A press brake is a machine pressing tool for bending sheet and plate material, most commonly sheet metal.
                     It forms predetermined bends by clamping the workpiece between a matching punch and die.</p>

                     <p>The fabrication drawing contains information on how to build the printed circuit board (PCB).
                 While your assembly drawing depicts details on how several components are going to fit on the raw PCB.</p>
